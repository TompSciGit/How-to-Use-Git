## My Motivation 
My motivation is to be able to join the opensource community and contribute.  The reason I chose to learn how to use Git and Github is because **Git and Github are popular tools used by developers** and to have some kind of version control for my life *lol*.  If you find yourself this far into reading aobut how to use Git, you clearly need to learn it, so please be bothered to read this.

My goals are to put a poem on Github for everyone to contribute to and learn how to use Git and Github along the way.

## What is Git and Github?
* Git is a piece of version control software you can download and run on any computer. It allows you to revert changes and keep track of changes to a project. 
* Github is a webservice where you can do Git things on a server. Upload your project to the internet intsead of hosting it on your local machine.

Git is a bash command-line interface where the user types in specific commands and stuff gets done. Github allows the user to do all this stuff in a graphical user interface and also displays the files in a nice way too. For the sake of this tutorial, I am going to walk through how to use the Github GUI so you know what things do and why they are there. Then I will talk through Git and the bash interface.

## Where are you right now?
You're browsing the web on a, you guessed it... a web-browser.  It doesn't matter if you're browsing through chrome or if you are one of the cool kids using internet explorer, you'll see the same thing, just might be slower for some and not for others :).

The web page you're viewing is one of my repositories. A repository is almost like a file where you can store your data online. This 'repo' is hosted on the Github website. You can see at the top of the page, it says 'TompSciGit/How-To-Use-Git', this is because this repo is stored under my username on the Github website. Everyone else has a different username with their own repos.

The next thing to notice in the browser is the list of files. **insert pic here** These are the files in your current repo. Some of the files you might see are listed below. If you would like to know why certain files are there and why they are called what they are then please jump to [poop].
* .gitingore
* README.md

Moving on, below the list of files, there is this 'README.md' windowy type thing **insert pic here**. This is the contents of the 'README.md' file which is listed in the file list above. Git assumes the README file needs to be read before anything can be done to the project and therefore it displays it nicely for everyone to see. Just like this. If you are wondering how I managed to make the README file look so nice with headers and bold captioning then please jump to [Markdown].

I think that is enough familiarisation of the website for now. You now know you are looking at my repo which is hosted on the Github webservice, and you also know where the list of files are in the repo. Now time to open a listed file and change it. 
> note: this is written with the persecrive that I will one day need this as notes to refresh my  memory. If you are not me, I love you & thanks for reading, but you will not be able to edit this repo without forking it first. Please see [Forking]

## Commiting a change with GitHub 
This section will guide you through making a 'commit' on the repo. It would probably be best to duplicate the tab on you're web browser and follow this tutorial while doing it.
